234tree-in-cpp
=============

A 2 3 4 tree implemented in C++17. Based on the slides [2-3-4 trees](http://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop3540/Chapter%2010%20-%202-3-4%20Trees%20-%20Part%201.ppt).
Go [here](http://cs.sou.edu/~harveyd/classes/cs511/docs/234Tree/tree.htm) to see a step-by-step animation of 2 3 4 tree. 

Issue: The code works fine. See todo.rst for comments about the efficiency of ``tree234::iterator(const iterator&)``.

Further documentations is at [Implementing a 2 3 4 Tree in C++17](http://cplusplus.kurttest.com/notes/tree234.html).
